Our chosen dataset was the sentiment dataset. The dataset consists of tweets and their respective sentiments.

The dataset is recieved as a stream and hence we have used two iterative learning algorithms PassiveAggressiveClassigier and SGDClassifier.

Finally from our results we plotted graphs to understand the data and models. The graphs consist of a word frequency graph featuring top 50 words. And 2 graphs on the learning progress of the PAC and SGD models.
